> **Abstract:** *Understanding of GAN training is still very limited. One major challenge is the non-convex-non-concave min-max objective in GAN training, which may lead to sub-optimal local minima. In this work, we perform a global landscape analysis of GANs using the empirical version. We prove that the original GAN formulation has exponentially many bad basins which are perceived as mode-collapse. We also study a modification to the original loss called RS-GAN (relative standard GAN) which couples the generated samples and the true samples, and prove that RS-GAN has no bad basins. Experiments on the synthetic data show that the predicted bad basin can indeed appear in training. We also perform a few experiments to support our theory that RS-GAN has a better landscape than JS-GAN. For instance, we empirically show that RS-GAN performs better than JS-GAN with relatively narrow neural nets.

## Training

There are three main parts of experiments:

* `GAN2_2Cluster.py`: train 1d-cluster experiments for both JS-GAN and RS-GAN. Generated data and projections will be in the folder 1dclusterresults; Evolution of Dloss and generated data will be in the folder DLoss_Data_Evolution.


* `5gaussian.py`: 5 Gaussian experiments. Generated images will be 5gaussian folder.
* `rsgan.py` and `vanillaGAN.py`: Real Image experiments. We provide some commands in scripts.txt



## Evaluation

We provide three evaluation metrics in `eval.py`: FID, Inception Score and Precision and Recall for Distributions.

e.g. to evaluate the regular CNN model on CIFAR-10, do

```
python eval.py --metric FID --dataset cifar --structure dcgan --image_size 32 --num_features 64 --model_path [the/model/path]
```



## Pre-trained Models

We include pretrained models in the folder `pretrained-model`.
